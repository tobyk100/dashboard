%p
  Instead of making you spend a lot of time individually importing student data, you can set up your class quickly
  by asking them to signup. Your students will need to choose usernames and passwords, but they WON'T be required to
  provide an email address. If a student forgets their password, you will be able to reset it for them.
%p
  Ask your students to visit
  %b= link_to 'code.org/join', 'http://code.org/join'
  and enter their section-code:
  %br/
  - if current_user.sections.empty?
    First, please #{link_to 'add a section', new_section_path}
  - else
    - current_user.sections.each do |section|
      For
      %b= section.name
      enter:
      %b= section.code
      = link_to '(Send in email)', build_invite_mailto(section, current_user), target: :_blank
      %br/
